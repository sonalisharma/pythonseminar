For this assignment i used my laptop which is a
Macbook Pro with 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 with 4 cores\

From the plot it is clearly visible that for small number of darts, serial processing
performs much better but as the number of darts increase, multiprocessing and Ipcluster
performs better.
The time taken for processing consistently increases as the number of darts increase.

Simulation Rate in case of serial processing is much lower that parallel processing.
